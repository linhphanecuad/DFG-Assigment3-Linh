      <h1>Pham Hau</h1>
      <p>Born in 1903 in the province of Ha Dong, Pham Hau graduated in 1934 after five years of his studies at the
        École des Beaux Arts de Hanoi. Under the tutelage of professor and painter Joseph Inguimberty, Pham Hau spent
        many of his days in the École's Lacquer Workshop, where he also became friends with the likes of To Ngoc Van,
        Tran Quang Tran, Nguyen Khang, Tran Van Can and Nguyen Gia Tri.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, it was not until the 1940s that Pham Hau gained notoriety for the skilled lacquer technique that would
        eventually become his hallmark. Along with fellow Nguyen Gia Tri, École des Beaux Arts and veteran Inguimberty,
        the two artists brought public attention to their skilled and intricate works, and soon gained a reputation for
        being the Les Maitres Lacquers de Hanoi.

      </p>
      <p>
        The Golden Age of Vietnamese Paintings (1930-1945), which came as a result of such artists, left remarkable and
        exquisite works of art that aimed to capture the essence of Vietnamese aesthetics. The classically styled, yet
        subtle new medium lacquer brought forth a revival. The Lacquer Revival itself became both an important movement
        and a new chapter in Modern Vietnamese art. One that inspired French visionaries and Vietnamese artists, while
        also becoming renowned globally as the specialty of Asian art in that era.

      </p>
      <p>
        Pham Hau's pioneering vision made him one of his generation's best and his works are considered of limited
        numbers. This wonderful piece represents beauty, composition and perfection, which truely reflects the dexterity
        of Vietnamese Modern Paintings.
